- Hi, I’m @thecrusader25225
- I’m interested in Game development, Coding, Cinematics and Video editing.
- I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 4 for Game development, Adobe Premiere Pro for Video Editing and Programming languages - C++, JAVA and Python.
- I’m looking to collaborate with newbies who are also learning Unreal Engine 4 to team up together and make our first project. In that way we will gain experience and confidence and learn together.
- I wish to create a company with Game developers of the future. A company is nothing but a group of people with same mindset, so if anyone interested in this genre please contact me, it will benefit both of us.
- Learners of any age are welcome.
